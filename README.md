# Iris-Flower-Classification
Classify iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on measurements of their petals and sepals.

 Dataset: The classic Iris dataset from UCI Repository or scikit-learn.

 Steps:

o Load the dataset and explore it visually (scatter plots or histograms).

o Split the data into training/test sets.

o Preprocess if needed (usually, it's already clean).

o Train a simple classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision
Tree).

o Evaluate with accuracy, precision, or confusion matrix.

 Skills gained: Numeric data analysis, classification modeling, evaluating results.
